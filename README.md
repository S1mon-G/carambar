#Let's hear a joke !

Here you'll find a carambar joke generator i did as part of a technical test.

The idea was to make a fullstack app and make it run smoothly.

I tried to have fun and did it to the best of my abilities, hope you enjoy it !

How to run:

clone this repo
npm install
npm run dev on the client side
node --watch server.js on the server side

have a laugh ;)
